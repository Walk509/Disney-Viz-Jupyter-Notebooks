# Disney-Viz-Jupyter-Notebooks

This Jupyter Notebook contains the code used to scrape IMDB Search page for movie data.

To create the dataset for the Pixar Viz just run the code. It will add more movies than found in the final dataset and has additional data not needed for this particular visualization. I then deleted columns not needed in excel. I then removed any entry that was not a feature film released in theaters.

The date only includes year and so I pulled the release date manually from the individual pages and added the box office sales for Onward.
